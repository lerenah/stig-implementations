## [WN11-AU-000510 — System Event Log Size Configured](https://www.stigaview.com/products/win11/v1r5/WN11-AU-000510/)

### Overview
This STIG ensures that the **Windows System event log is configured with sufficient capacity** to retain important operating system and service-related events. Proper log sizing prevents critical system events from being overwritten too quickly.

---

### Why this matters
The System event log records events generated by Windows system components, drivers, and services. If the log size is too small:

- Important system events may be overwritten
- Indicators of system instability or compromise may be lost
- Incident response and forensic investigations may lack critical context
- Administrators may need to constantly monitor and clear logs

Ensuring an adequate System log size supports **reliable auditing, system troubleshooting, and security monitoring**.

Because insufficient logging can hinder detection and response capabilities, DISA classifies this as a **CAT II (Medium Severity)** finding.

The system is considered **non-compliant** if the following registry value is missing or incorrectly configured (unless logs are forwarded directly to an external audit server and documented as NA):

- **Registry Hive:** `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`
- **Registry Path:**
